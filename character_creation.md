# Shadowforge Character Creation System

## 1. Choosing a Race

The first step in creating a character is selecting a race. Each race comes with its own unique traits, abilities, and bonuses that influence the character's strengths and weaknesses.

- **Example Races:**
  - **Human:** Versatile and adaptable, with balanced stats.
  - **Elf:** Agile and perceptive, with bonuses to Agility and Wit.
  - **Dwarf:** Sturdy and resilient, with bonuses to Might and Resolve.

## 2. Choosing a Background

Backgrounds define a character’s past, influencing their starting skills, resources, and role in the world. This choice provides additional flavor and mechanical benefits.

- **Example Backgrounds:**
  - **Soldier:** A disciplined fighter with bonuses to combat-related skills.
  - **Scholar:** An educated individual with bonuses to knowledge-based skills.
  - **Outlaw:** A rogue with bonuses to stealth and deception skills.

## 3. Assigning Core Points (CP)

Core Points (CP) are used to assign values to a character’s core attributes. These points define the character’s inherent strengths and abilities.

- **Attributes:**
  - **Might:** Physical strength and endurance.
  - **Agility:** Dexterity and speed.
  - **Resolve:** Willpower and determination.
  - **Wit:** Intelligence and quick thinking.
  - **Charm:** Charisma and social influence.

- **CP Allocation:**
  - Players start with a set number of CP (e.g., 10 CP) to distribute among the attributes, creating a unique profile for their character.

## 4. Spending Skill Points (SP)

Skill Points (SP) are used to unlock abilities within specific skill trees. The choice of skill trees is influenced by the character's race, background, and desired playstyle.

- **Skill Trees:**
  - **Combat Skill Trees:** Focus on specific weapon types (e.g., Swordsmanship, Axe Mastery, Archery).
  - **Magic Skill Trees:** Focus on specific schools of magic (e.g., Fire Magic, Ice Magic, Arcane Magic).
  - **Support Skill Trees:** Focus on healing, buffing, and utility abilities.
  - **Social Skill Trees:** Focus on persuasion, deception, and leadership abilities.
  - **Stealth Skill Trees:** Focus on stealth, evasion, and subterfuge abilities.

- **SP Allocation:**
  - Players start with a base pool of SP (e.g., 10 SP) to invest in their chosen skill trees. Each tier in the skill trees costs double the SP of the previous tier, encouraging careful investment.
