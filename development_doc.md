## Core Tenets of Shadowforge

1. **Action-Packed Combat**
   - Fast, fluid, and tactical combat that keeps players engaged with a flexible action economy and dynamic movement rules.

2. **Endless Character Customization**
   - A modular character creation system that allows for deep customization and flexibility, catering to various playstyles.

3. **Balanced Role-Playing and Exploration Mechanics**

4. **Easy to Learn, Deep to Master**
   - Streamlined rules that are accessible for new players but offer layers of depth for veterans, with modular complexity to suit different playstyles.

## Action-Packed Combat

### Core Focus

Dynamic and fast-paced combat that minimizes downtime and encourages strategic movement and decision-making.

### Key Elements

- **Action Economy**
  - Flexible Action System: Players have a pool of "Action Points" (AP) to spend on different actions each turn.
  - Multi-Action Turns: Players can perform multiple smaller actions in a single turn by spending AP.

- **Movement and Positioning**
  - Dynamic Movement Rules: Encourage movement with bonuses for flanking, high ground, or cover.
  - Reduced Penalties for Movement: Modify or remove opportunity attacks to encourage tactical repositioning.

- **Combat Abilities and Spells**
  - Flexible Spellcasting: Combine lower-level spells or cast multiple spells in a turn if AP allows.
  - Tactical Abilities: Debuffs, area control, and teamwork-enhancing buffs.

### Actionable Steps

1. Design and prototype the action point system.
2. Playtest different action point costs for balance.
3. Iterate based on feedback.

## Endless Character Customization

### Core Focus

A deep and flexible character creation system that allows players to craft unique characters.

### Key Elements

- **Modular Character Creation System**
  - Point-Based Character Building: Players allocate points across attributes, skills, and abilities.
  - Hybrid Classes and Archetypes: Mix and match abilities from different archetypes to create unique classes.

- **Skill and Ability Customization**
  - Skill Trees and Ability Paths: Offer branching choices for developing skills and abilities.
  - Customization Options: Modify or combine abilities to create new effects.

### Actionable Steps

1. Develop a prototype for the point-based character creation system.
2. Playtest hybrid class builds and skill trees.
3. Gather feedback on customization options.

### Visual Aid Suggestion

## Balanced Role-Playing and Exploration Mechanics

### Core Focus

Creating an immersive world where role-playing and exploration are as rewarding as combat.

### Key Elements

- **Role-Playing Mechanics**
  - Social Interaction System: Mechanics for diplomacy, deception, and negotiation.

- **Exploration Mechanics**
  - Dynamic Exploration System: Rewards for discovery, resource management, and environmental interaction.
  - Resource Management: Track supplies, manage fatigue, and deal with environmental effects.

### Actionable Steps

1. Create prototypes for social interaction and exploration mechanics.
2. Playtest the impact of reputation and faction systems.
3. Iterate based on narrative-driven progression feedback.
